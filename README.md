# Next.js Final Project

## Overview

This project is a web application built using Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. The application for the moment fetches and displays posts from a public API, allowing users to view, sort, and interact with the content. The app will, in the future, be able to host the users posts and allow them to interact with each other.

## Features

- Fetches posts from the [DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/posts).
- Displays posts with titles, body content, and user reactions (likes and dislikes).
- Sorts posts by score (likes - dislikes) in descending order.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
